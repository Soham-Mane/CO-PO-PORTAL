# CO-PO-PORTAL
Course Outcome and Practical Outcome are the data which are calculated by every professor in the college at the end of each semester. Earlier professor used to calculate these on Excel sheet which used to take 3-4 days to calculate and and recheck these values but through our portal they just have to upload the excel sheet of students' data and they will get the expected result in the form of new excel sheet within a minute.
Apart from this there is also a dedicated dashboard for teachers to analyse all the data for any invidual class of their choice.
